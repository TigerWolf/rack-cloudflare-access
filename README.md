# Rack::CloudflareAccess

This is a rack middleware to add Cloudflare access to your application. This
means that you can turn on SSO with cloudflare Zero Trust and ensure all
requests to your application are authenticated.

This middleware is also designed to work with Rails and to raise an error that
is captured by Rails erorr handling if any part of the process fails.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add rack-cloudflare-access

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install rack-cloudflare-access

## Usage

You will need to have a Cloudflare the team url and aud. You can set this up
here:
https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/#start-from-the-cloudflare-dashboard

In order to retreive your AUD you will need to decrypt a JWT token generated by
Cloudflare for your application. It used to be possible to access this from your
Cloudflare Dashboard but I can no longer find it. An AUD is required to ensure
tokens from other applcations are not used to access your application.

Once you have these, you can add the middleware to your Rack application. In rails:

```
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(Rack::CloudflareAccess::Middleware, <aud>, <teams_url>)
```

Rack, in your config.ru file add:
```
use(Rack::CloudflareAccess::Middleware, <aud>, <teams_url>)
```

Replace the aud and the teams_url with those from Cloudflare.
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

# Future improvements and features

* Allow for urls to be filtered out (e.g. login)
* More efficient HTTP library for getting the certs - for now just keep it simple
* Better rails integration? .present? and deep_symbolize_keys! could use quite useful
